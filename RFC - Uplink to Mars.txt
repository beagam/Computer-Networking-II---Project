1.  Introduction

   The following documents states suggestions and recommendations in order
   to establish an uplink communications with Mars. The addresses that
   will used and the submission for a domain are stated as basic 
   specifications.

   Suggestions regarding the management of missing packages so that the
   latency is below 45 minutes are made, focusing on the situation where
   the Earth and Mars are furthest (when the Sun is the middle). The use
   of a relay station is suggested, specifying the location and logical
   functionality of such station, in order to proccess the missing 
   packets.

   On the application layer, TCP/IP is used for convenience, as it is
   widely used and the code is avaliable.

   (easy), top-level domains (also easy) and, most importantly, actually 
   making it possible for colonists to communicate with hosts back on 
   Earth. It is required that users are able to use TCP/IP on the 
   application layer (as it is too costly to rewrite all software from 
   scratch), which calls for some sort of proxy servers to address the 
   issue with propagation time from Mars to Earth (anywhere from 3 to 
   30 minutes). The proposed solution needs to address the issue of 
   packet damage during transfer from Earth to Mars during opposition 
   (when distance is furthest). In particular, any packet lost in 
   transit from Earth to Mars would need to be retransmitted, increasing   
   overall delivery latency to absolutely intolerable 75 minutes, thus 
   making any sort of human-to-human interaction totally unmanageable. 
   A reasonable solution to this needs to be suggested, such that 
   overall maximum delay could be confined to somewhere around 45 
   minutes. Keep in mind that you would likely require some form of 
   a relay station such that signal could be routed around the Sun 
   (as it is a pretty strong noise source). The position and 
   functionality of such relay station is entirely up to your 
   decision."


2  Basic specifications

   In the following section the basic specifications of the 
   communication link between the Earth and Mars are described. In 
   order to establish the link, it is needed to assign the addresses
   an a top-level domain.

2.1.  Network topology

2.2.  Addresses


2.1. IP Addresses

   (1) Introduction
    
   In order to connect to the Earth`s Internet network, hosts in Mars
   need IP addresses to be able to use TCP/IP as host in Earth do 
   almost every time when using Internet conexion.
  
   IPv4 have already runned out in Earth and IPv6 is being deployed 
   slowly due to introduce IPv6 to completely sustitude IPv4 would be 
   very costly regarding both hardware and software and because there 
   are watechniquesys, like Ipv6 transition tunneling to allow both 
   versions to coexist. In our case, as we are going to develop the 
   network from scratch, we have decided to use IPv6 from the 
   beginning.  

   This IPs could be assigned manualy if desired, but this is a very 
   tedious work that makes no sense when designing a network topology 
   continiously changing and growing. As said beofore, assign static 
   IPs is always a chioce and in some cases is even better for specific
   needs, but an automatic procedure is required to simplify and 
   automate the configuration of the internet access and make life 
   easier to every client of the network who desired it.

   (3) IPv6 addresses

   In the earth, only three /3 IPv6 addresses blocks are used and 
   thatâ€™s enough to cover all the needs by the moment, so we have 
   decided to start using only one /3 block to cover all Mars due to at
   the beginning there would be only some small settlements and in case
   the population increase leading to the need of more IP addresses, we
   can always extend the range.

   As in the Earth, a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) would be created 
   to manage the IPv6 addresses allocated to Mars and distribute them 
   between the different Internet Service Providers (ISP) whose task 
   would be to assign these IPs to the clients in Mars in a reasonable 
   manner. ISPs receive groups of addresses with prefix /48 and these or
   subnets derived from them are the ones delivered to the clients. 
   Besides, as in IPv4, in order to save addresses and hide private
   networks, Network Address Translation (NAT) is going to be 
   implemented to map theses public addresses into several private ones 
   allowing to create private networks that access the internet using a 
   single public IPv6 Network.

	 (2) SLAAC & DHCP for dynamic IPs

	 For the dynamic assignment of IPs presented before, IPv6 offers two
   kinds of address autoconfiguration. 
   
   On the one hand, stateful autoconfiguration technique is accomplished 
   using the well-known Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
   (DHCPv6) specified in the RFC 8415. This protocol, the evolution of 
   DHCP used in IPv4, uses DHCP servers that assigns dynamically IPv6 
   addresses and other configuration information needed to stablish a 
   connection to the rest of IP networks, like network masks, a default
   gateway and DNS server, to every host (DCHP client) that request it 
   and prove to have the rights to get that information.

   On the second hand, a new approach, Stateless Address 
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), defined in the RFC 7217 has being 
   developed allowing    IPv6 hosts to automatically generate IP 
   addresses internally without communicate with any other node in the
   network and in a secure way. First, a 64-bit prefix is assigned to a 
   node interface and then, the 64 bits missing are assigned using the 
   EUI-64 ADDRESS FORMAT and some unique and known information like MAC 
   addresses. This method is very useful and simple but other information
   may be required, like DNS servers or IPv6 prefixes. In order to get
   this info, hosts can use DHCP together with SLAAC or another stateless 
   autoconfiguration protocol, Neighbour Discovery Protocol (ND), used to
   get information required for internet communication like DNS or default
   gateways.

3.  Relay station

   In the following section, the specifications regarding the relay
   station that will be used in order to route the signal around the
   Sun are described. The purpose of using such station is that the 
   noise produced in this area will interfer and jam the signal, so 
   its use is suggested for filtering purposes. The proposal includes
   two spacecrafts acting as relay stations.

3.1.  Location

   When any type of satellite or station is placed onto the space, it
   will follow the natural orbit around the Sun (also referred as orbit
   A) called the Keplerian orbits. If the relay station is placed on the
   Keplerian orbits, the communications will be blocked by the Sun at 
   some points, which will lead to uncontinuous communications between
   the Earth and Mars.

   According to the paper "Non-Keplerian Orbits Using Low Thrust,
   High ISP Propulsion Systems" there is a way
   to overcome this problem, by placing the satellite on the B orbits
   (also called non-Keplerian orbits), which are displaced orbits. It has
   been shown that if you can provide continuous thrust, it is possible to
   place two different satellites that would work as the relay stations
   and provide continuous communications between the Earth and Mars. There
   is need to place two relay stations beacause that way it is ensured that
   that at least one of them would always be in view of both planets,
   according to the ESA engineer.

   The process of thrusting is a high-consumption task for the spacecraft, 
   so the idea is to place the satellites on the B orbits while the 
   conjuction season lasts (when the Eart and Mars are furthest). Once it 
   is over, they will go back to the Keplerian orbits and save fuel.

   Therefore, the suggested location for the relay stations is the B orbits
   of Mars.
