Task 2: Uplink to Mars (latency)
In just a few years we need to be ready to incorporate the first settlements on Mars into the Internet. 
This means assigning addresses (easy), top-level domains (also easy) and, most importantly, actually making 
it possible for colonists to communicate with hosts back on Earth. 

It is required that users are able to use TCP/IP on the application layer 
(as it is too costly to rewrite all software from scratch), which calls for some sort of proxy servers 
to address the issue with propagation time from Mars to Earth (anywhere from 3 to 30 minutes). 
The proposed solution needs to address the issue of packet damage during transfer from Earth to 
Mars during opposition (when distance is furthest). In particular, any packet lost in transit from 
Earth to Mars would need to be retransmitted, increasing overall delivery latency to absolutely 
intolerable 75 minutes, thus making any sort of human-to-human interaction totally unmanageable. 

A reasonable solution to this needs to be suggested, such that overall maximum delay could be confined 
to somewhere around 45 minutes. Keep in mind that you would likely require some form of a relay station 
such that signal could be routed around the Sun (as it is a pretty strong noise source). The position and 
functionality of such relay station is entirely up to your decision.
